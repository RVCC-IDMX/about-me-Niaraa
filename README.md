My name is Niara Afriyie. In this project I learned a lot about the process of developing a webpage. I learned how to create a Git repository on GitHub to store and manage my changes from my source code. I learned about Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) the layout and structure of a webpage, Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) how the content within the file is structured, and UX and UI design and how the user interacts with the media. For my color scheme I used #FD756A, #E35F80, #FA76DA, #D15FE3, #C16AFD. As I kept going I realized some of my colors clashed and I had to change it up a bit so I started adding #98213f, #661c53 as darker shades to contrast the brighter colors. I want to apply what I have learned into creating websites for other people and continue to enhance my own. I wish to reserve all copyrights.
