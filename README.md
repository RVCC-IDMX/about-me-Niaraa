My name is Niara Afriyie. In this project I learned a lot about the process of developing a webpage. I learned how to create a Git repository on GitHub to store and manage my changes from my source code. I learned about Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) the layout and structure of a webpage, Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) how the content within the file is structured, and UX and UI design and how the user interacts with the media.I wish to reserve all copyrights.
