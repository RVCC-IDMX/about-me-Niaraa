<h2>Image Hover Effects Article</h2>

<div>

   <p>What exactly are Image hover effects? Image hover effects are animations that trigger the image when the pointer floats or presses over it. There are different types of image hover effects. Some may change the color when floating over the image, others may change the size of the image or words. It can make the image shrink, enlarge, rotate, and pretty much change the image into whatever you want it to do. Hover effects are important when creating a website. Most websites have this effect, and we don’t even pay attention to how crucial and important it is to put the site together when choosing options or clicking different buttons on a site. </p>
<p> Hover effects are used like GIF, videos, and other types of animations, except, hover effects do not slow down the website and you can use as many as you want and the site will continue to run smoothly. It is used to make the users experience better and to mark the essential items on the page. It takes the user to a specific part of a page immediately and smoothly, so the user doesn’t take long to scroll through the whole webpage to find one section or item. </p>
<p> There are so many visual examples found. As you hover over an image it can blur the image, tilt it, brighten, add a border, image can become 3D, image can fade, can go from grayscale to color and so much more. On websites we typically see the hover add a border or change size, but it can do so much more that users are not aware of and can make the experience a lot smoother for the user.</p>
<p> “Letting users easily and clearly know which part of the webpage is clickable is an important part of UX design.”As shown at the top of the website as an example, the four main buttons are “Bio, Gallery, Blog, Contact Me” to show the user that these are the four main parts on the site that have easy access to get to, the color of the word changes as the pointer floats over it. As said above, these mark the essential items on the page. You can use hover effects for pictures and anything else you’d like but using it for the menu bar shows the user what the main purpose is for the site. </p>
